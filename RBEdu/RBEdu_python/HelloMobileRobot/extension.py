"""
This file serves as a basic template for the standard boilerplate operations
that make a UI-based extension appear on the toolbar.

This implementation is meant to cover most use-cases without modification.
Various callbacks are hooked up to a seperate class UIBuilder in .ui_builder.py
Most users will be able to make their desired UI extension by interacting solely with
UIBuilder.

This class sets up standard useful callback functions in UIBuilder:
    on_menu_callback: Called when extension is opened
    on_timeline_event: Called when timeline is stopped, paused, or played
    on_physics_step: Called on every physics step
    on_stage_event: Called when stage is opened or closed
    cleanup: Called when resources such as physics subscriptions should be cleaned up
    build_ui: User function that creates the UI they want.
